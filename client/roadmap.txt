Authify Frontend — Clear Roadmap (Feature‑by‑Feature, in build order)
Think of each bullet as a sprint ticket. Finish it, test it, then move on.
Follow this sequence and you’ll never wonder “what’s next?”.

🅰️ FOUNDATION
Project scaffold

Next 15 App Router, TS, Tailwind 4, ShadCN, Framer Motion ✔️ (done)

Design system seed

Create UI kit: Button, Input, Card, Typography tokens.

Set primary/secondary colors, dark‑mode toggle.

🅱️ AUTH FLOW (MVP)
Mirror backend endpoints one‑for‑one.

Step	Page / Component	Backend route it calls	Acceptance test
1	Login page (credentials)	POST /login	Valid creds → redirects to /dashboard
2	Signup page	POST /signup	Sends OTP email, redirects to /verify-otp
3	OTP Verify page	POST /verify-otp	Correct OTP → logged‑in session
4	Forgot Password page	POST /forgot-password	Shows “OTP sent” toast
5	Reset Password page	POST /reset-password	New password accepted

Tech specifics: Use React Hook Form + Zod on each page; call signIn("credentials") for login/signup after the backend responds OK.

🅲️ SESSION & ROUTE PROTECTION
NextAuth credentials provider wired (JWT stored in session).

Middleware.ts

Blocks /dashboard/** if no session.

Blocks /admin/** if session.role !== admin.

Global AuthProvider hook to expose user, isVerified, role.

🅳️ DASHBOARD (User)
Feature	Route	UI pieces
Profile summary	/dashboard	Avatar, email, “verified” badge
Update password	/dashboard/security	RHF form, calls /change-password
Notification prefs (future)	/dashboard/notifications	Toggle switches

🅴️ ADMIN PANEL
Feature	Route	API	Notes
Users list	/admin/users	GET /admin/users	Table, pagination
Edit role	inline	PUT /admin/role/:id	ShadCN Select
Delete user	inline	DELETE /admin/:id	Confirm dialog
Analytics	/admin/analytics	GET /admin/metrics	Charts (Recharts)

🅵️ POLISH & UX
3D / particles background in app/layout.tsx (react‑tsparticles).

Page transitions with Framer Motion (fade/slide).

Toast notifications (ShadCN toast or sonner).

Accessible focus states & keyboard nav audit.

Responsive tweaks for mobile.

🅶️ NICE‑TO‑HAVES (after MVP)
Google & GitHub OAuth buttons (signIn("google"), "github").

Theme switcher (dark/light system detection).

Password strength meter (zxcvbn).

Rate‑limit error handling: show cooldown timer.

Live metrics via websockets on Admin Analytics.

🚦 Build Order Checklist
UI kit primitives (1 day)

Login page → session confirmed (½ day)

Signup + OTP verify (1½ days)

Forgot / Reset password (1 day)

Middleware route guards (½ day)

Dashboard profile + change‑pw (1 day)

Admin: users table CRUD (2 days)

Admin: analytics charts (1 day)

Global polish & animations (ongoing)

Tackle them in that order; each stage unlocks the next and keeps your scope clear.

Next action:
Finish Step 2 of AUTH FLOW (Signup page) or whichever you haven’t done yet, then ping me with progress/blockers. We’ll zoom into the exact page and validation logic like we did for the Login card.
